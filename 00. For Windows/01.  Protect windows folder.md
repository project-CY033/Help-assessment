# Explain
- ### cacls: This is the command-line utility used to display or modify access control lists (ACLs) of files and folders.
- ### "s": This specifies the file or folder to which you want to apply the ACL changes. In this case, "s" could be the name of a file or folder.
- ### /e: This switch edits the ACL instead of replacing it. It allows you to make changes to the existing ACL without overwriting it.
- ###  /p: This switch specifies that you want to set the permissions for the specified user or group.
- ###  everyone:f: This grants the "everyone" group Full Control (f) over the file or folder.
- ### everyone:n: This revokes all permissions (n) for the "everyone" group.
